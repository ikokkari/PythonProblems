# 109 Python Problems for CCPS 109

This repository contains the problem specifications, the automated tester and the necessary data files for the graded lab problems for the course *CCPS 109 Computer Science I*, as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/) for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Toronto Metropolitan University, Toronto, Canada. The lecture material and example Python programs of that course are also freely available in the GitHub repository [ikokkari/PythonExamples](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonExamples).

The specifications for all these lab problems are collected in the file [109 Python Problems.pdf](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/main/109%20Python%20Problems%20for%20CCPS%20109.pdf). Another set of problems is being collected to the ongoing document [Additional Python Problems.pdf](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/main/Additional%20Python%20Problems.pdf), currently holding 41 new problems in addition to the main problem collection. Both collections use the same automated tester script [tester109.py](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/main/tester109.py) to verify the solutions.

These problems are suitable for students who have already completed some introductory collection of finger practice exercises on Python language basics, such as [CodingBat Python](https://codingbat.com/python). The author also has a [similar collection of Java problems](https://github.com/ikokkari/CCPS209Labs) suitable for a second course on object oriented programming in Java and the first course on data structures and algorithms. Everyone teaching or learning Python is welcome to use, adapt and distribute these problems and the associated acceptance tester for their own purposes as they see fit. The author welcomes feedback by email at `ilkka.kokkarinen@gmail.com` from computer science instructors who use these problems in their courses. The author believes that there is room for all races on Earth to live, prosper and get strong at coding by solving the *109 Python Problems*.

A bounty for each bonus problem is available to the first person to solve that problem. The file [bounty.md](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/main/bounty.md) contains more information.

Obfuscated model solutions are available in the file `obfuscated.txt`, to give students the idea of the length and general complexity of the instructor's private solutions.
